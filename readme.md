# Credit Delinquent/Default Preditive Analysis

## Business Context
Banks generate revenue primarily by lending money to borrowers. To maximize profits and maintain a good reputation, they need to identify borrowers who may have trouble repaying their loans. When borrowers fail to make payments, we often categorize them as "delinquent" or "defaulted."

- Delinquent borrowers are slightly behind on their payments.
- Defaulted borrowers have been behind for a long time and are unlikely to repay.
- This project aims to identify borrowers likely to default in the next two years after being seriously delinquent for more than three months.
- We use various borrower characteristics and historical data to predict this risk.
- These predictions help banks take proactive measures.

---

## Objective
Build a model using borrower information and historical records to predict serious delinquency within the next two years.
